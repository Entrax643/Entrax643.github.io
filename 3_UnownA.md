| Collectability   | Set the collectability to reach when gathering an items as collectable.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Rotation         | It's the rotation used when you don't want an item as collectable. I highly suggest to let this as Unspoiled unless you know exactly what you're doing and wich specific rotation you want to use.                                                                |
| Gather Increase  | It's the specific rotation when you are gathering non collectable item : <br>**Yield:** +2 Yield items / +5% or 15% Yield rate.<br>**Quality:** +30% Quality / +5% or 15% Yield rate.<br>**YieldAndQuality** +2 Yield items / +10% Quality rate / +5% Yield rate. |
| Disable Override | If Enable it'll disable auto rotation selection and not use any GP on Unspoiled nodes.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Cordial Type     | Set what type of cordial you want to use. Auto will use all cordial depending on what you have and how many GP are miussing.                                                                                                                                       |
| Cordial Time     | Set what logic you want to use for Cordial usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
