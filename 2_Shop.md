## Turn In
### Enable Turn In :
If enable it'll try to turn in your collectable items for scrips based on Minimum Free Slot setting.
			
### Minimum Free Slot :
Set the minimum free slots amount to start Turn In. For instance, if set to 140 it'll always try to turn in because you'll always have less than 100 free slot, with 20 it'll only go turn in when you have less than 20 free slots. The security limit is 5 so even if you set less than five it'll act as it was 5.
